## Installation

You can install @jolt/cli using npm.

Install using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jolt/cli):
```bash
npm install -g @jolt/cli
```

You can also skip installing it and generate a project directly:

```bash
npx @jolt/cli <my-app>
```

---

## Project Scaffolding

To generate a project, you just need to run the `create` command followed by the name of your app.
If the name of your app was `example.com`, you would run `jolt create example.com`.

This command generates a project for development using [Jolt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jolt), 
and installs the neccessary dependencies and sets up the configuration files for you.
