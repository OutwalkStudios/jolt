# Welcome to your new App!

This project was generated using [@jolt/cli](https://github.com/OutwalkStudios/jolt/tree/master/jolt-cli).

---

## Getting Started

To get started with developing your new project, you have several npm scripts avaible.

- `npm run dev` </br>
This command will build the project every time a file is saved as well as launch a live development server. This is the quickest way to get to developing. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your app in the browser.

- `npm run build` </br>
This command will build the project, and will output `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` in the `public` folder.

- `npm run lint` </br>
This command will run eslint on your source code.

- `npm run docs` </br>
This command will generate documentation from JSDoc comments into a `docs` folder.

- `npm run start` </br>
This command will run the development server, and serve the app from the `public` folder.

## Extending the Template

`@jolt/cli` has no concept of "ejecting", instead it generates the configuration files in the `config` folder, you can install and setup tools to work directly with the existing config. The config that is generated is designed to be as simple and straight forward to make extending it as easy as possible.
