# Welcome to your new App!

This project was bootstrapped using the [Jolt CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jolt/cli).

---

## Getting Started

To get started with developing your new project, you have several npm scripts available.

- `npm run build` </br>
This command will build the project, and will output `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` in the `public` folder.

- `npm run watch` </br>
This command will build your app every time a file is saved.

- `npm run lint` </br>
This command will run eslint on your source code.

- `npm run dev` </br>
This command will run a development server and rebuild if you change any of the source files.

---

## Customizing the Project

You can configure your project using the generated `jolt.json` file.
The toolchain set in your config file is what powers the cli commands as well as what config options are available.
Look at the documentation for your toolchain to determine what options are available.
