# Welcome to your new App!

This project was bootstrapped using the [Jolt CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jolt/cli).

---

## Getting Started

To get started with developing your new project, you have several npm scripts available.

- `npm run build` </br>
This command will build the project, and will output `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` in the `public` folder.

- `npm run watch` </br>
This command will build your app every time a file is saved.

- `npm run lint` </br>
This command will run eslint on your source code.

- `npm run dev` </br>
This command will run a development server and rebuild if you change any of the source files.

---

## Customizing the Project

 You can configure your project using the generated `jolt.json` file.
